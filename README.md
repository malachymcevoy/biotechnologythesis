# Biotechnology Thesis

This GitHub contains code relevant to my Biotechnology Honour's Project, entitled "Applying Optimization Algorithms to Biological Systems and Cell-Free Models".

Some files use Pluto, an interactive notebook environment for Julia (similar to Jupyter). To run these files, type the following into a Julia terminal:
using Pkg; Pkg.add(Pluto)
import Pluto; Pluto.run()
